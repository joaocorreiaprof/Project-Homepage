        <p class="about-text">
          I am João Correia, a web development student finishing The Odin
          Project and 42 School. My focus is on learning to create efficient,
          user-friendly websites, driven by a passion for problem-solving.
          Although new to the field, I am committed to growing my skills.
          Outside of coding, I find inspiration in running, playing the piano,
          and exploring robotics. I am eager to contribute to the tech community
          and make a positive impact through my work.
